        <li>
          8.1. This article only applies if Consumer is a natural person who is
          not acting in his or her professional or commercial capacity. If 21
          Bits gives a separate warranty on the products then, without prejudice
          to the aforesaid, this applies to all types of Consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
          8.2. 21 Bits guarantees that the products are in conformity with the
          Agreement, the specifications stated in the offer, the reasonable
          requirements of reliability and/or usability and with the existing
          statutory provisions and/or government regulations that are in force
          from the date of entering into the Agreement. If specifically agreed,

        <li>
          8.3. If the delivered product is not in conformity with the Agreement,

          normal use. Otherwise, it applies that the product is suitable for
          normal use.
        </li>
        <li>

          Consumer is no longer entitled to have the product repaired, replaced
          or (partially) refunded.
        </li>
        <li>
          9.3. If 21 Bits deems the complaint to be correct, the faulty

          in any case within 14 days after having received it. If it is not yet
          possible for 21 Bits to formulate a substantive reaction to the
          complaint by that time, 21 Bits will confirm receipt of the complaint
          within 14 days after having received it and give an indication of the
          term within which it expects to be able to give a substantive or
          definitive reaction to Customer's complaint.
        </li>
        <li>
          10.3. If Customer is a natural person who is not acting in his or her
          professional or commercial capacity, it can file a complaint through
          the European Online Dispute Resolution platform, available at:
          <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/odr/">http://ec.europa.eu/odr/</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Article 11. Liability</h2>
      <ol class="flat-list">
        <li>
          11.1. This Article only applies if Consumer is a natural person or a
          legal entity who is acting in a professional or commercial capacity.
        </li>
        <li>
          11.2. The total liability of 21 Bits in respect of Consumer due to an
          attributable failure to perform the Agreement is limited to

          Agreement (including VAT).
        </li>
        <li>
          11.3. The liability of 21 Bits in respect of Consumer for indirect
          damage or loss, which in any case includes – but is explicitly not
          limited to – consequential damage, lost profit, lost savings, loss of
          data and damage due to business interruption, is excluded.
        </li>
        <li>
          11.4. Aside from the cases referred to in the two previous paragraphs
          of this Article, 21 Bits is not subject to any liability at all in
          respect of Consumer for damages, irrespective of the ground on which
          the action for damages is based. The restrictions set out in this
          Article, will,however, cease to apply if and insofar as the damage or
          loss is the result of an intentional act or gross negligence on the
          part of 21 Bits.
        </li>
        <li>
          11.5. 21 Bits will only be liable to Consumer on account of an
          attributable failure in the performance of an agreement if Consumer
          issues a proper notice of default to 21 Bits without delay stipulating
          a reasonable period of time in which to remedy the failure, and 21
          Bits also continues to fail to perform its obligations after that
          period. The notice of default must contain a description of the
          failure in as much detail as possible to enable 21 Bits to provide an
          adequate response.
        </li>
        <li>
          11.6. Any event giving right to compensation is always subject to the
          condition that Consumer reports the damage or loss in writing to 21
          Bits as soon as possible, but no later than within 30 days after the
          damage or loss has arisen.
        </li>
        <li>
          11.7. In the event of force majeure 21 Bits is not liable to pay
          compensation for any damage or loss Consumer has incurred as a result.
        </li>
      </ol>

        <li>
          12.2. Before the transfer of ownership, Business Consumer is not
          authorized to, other than corresponding to his normal company and

          misappropriation. Furthermore, Business Consumer is not allowed to
          pawnthe goods or to give any rights regarding the goods to third
          parties as long as the transfer of ownership has not been completed.
        </li>
        <li>
          12.3. Business Consumer is obliged to keep any goods that are
          delivered under reservation of ownership with care and recognizable as
          property of 21 Bits.
        </li>
        <li>
          12.4. 21 Bits is entitled to withdraw any goods delivered under
          reservation of ownership and in the possession of Business Consumer,
          if Business Consumer has neglected to pay the invoices or has been

        <li>
          12.5. Business Consumer shall give 21 Bits access to his goods at any
