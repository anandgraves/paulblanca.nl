        Blanca’s interest in photography began after he met his contemporary,
        Eva Veldhoen. She was the daughter of painter Aat Veldhoen. Blanca began
        using a small, colour camera. He then took black and white photographs
        using a 6 x 6 cm Hasselblad camera. In the 1980s Blanca received
        recognition for his violent self-portraits inspired by the works of
        Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe.

        artists of the 1980s, complemented by the poems of Koos Dalstra.

        Blanca was influenced by the choreographer, photographer and
        photographic studio owner Hans van Manen. In van Manen’s work, Pose,
        Blanca played a kickboxer (Blanca had been a kickboxer in his teens)
        surrounded by ten ballerinas.

        society,including artists such as Grace Jones, Jasper Johns, Willem de
        Kooning and Keith Haring.[citation needed] Mapplethorpe said of Blanca,
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Paul Blanca is my only competitor.".
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In "True Colors – The Real Life of the Art World" by Anthony Haden, an
        art collector says,

      <blockquote>
        "He reaches a kind of poetry few artists have."
      </blockquote>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Themes</h2>

      <p>
        Blanca’s self-portraits reveal strong emotions and violence expressed
        through fear, aggression, pain, sadness and sexuality. However, a more
        sensitive side is shown in the nudes, "Mother and Son" and "Father and
        Son".[citation needed]
      </p>

      <p>
        The theme of strong emotion is also revealed in Blanca's series "Par la
        Pluie des Femmes", in which he captures women in tears by letting them
        think about their most traumatic experiences.
